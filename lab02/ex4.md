1. Describe the algorithm you will use to find the room. Assume all the information you have is the one given by the sign; you have no knowledge of the floor plan.

If the room number is between 100 and 130 (inclusive), go left and walk clockwise. Otherwise, go right and walk counterclockwise. Check the rooms one by one until you find the room. 

In this case, to find EY128 according to this algorithm, you would go left and continue until you find it.

2. How many ”steps” it will take to find room EY128? And what is “step” in this case?

It will take 15 "steps" to find EY128. In this case, one "step" is checking one room, and following the algorithm, EY128 would be the 15th room checked.
